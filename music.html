        <p>Two days ago G jones and Bleep Bloop released a collaboration EP. Both producers share a similar style of future bass/trap which makes for a powerhouse duo. This EP is packed with heavy 808s and deep bass. Also included was a remix of the track "Mind" by Lunice. Lunice is part of the famous duo TNGHT, and he absolutely slays his remix of an already amazing track. I am fully impressed with the sound on this entire release. If you like bass heavy trap beats defiitely give this one a listen.</p>

        <p>New music from an old name in the game Tipper! This one is called "Its Like EP" and showcases Tipper's uptempo bass heavy style. Tipper is a British producer and DJ who quickly rose up the ranks in the american festival circuit. Even though its only four tracks this EP is packed with classic glitchy Tipper beats. The first track, the title track, "Its Like" holds nothing back, and leaves you wanting more. Don't worry though because theres more where that came from!</p>

        <p>Another recent release from Freddy Todd, Khrysos EP! Khrysos in Greek mythology is the spirit of gold and thats what this EP is, pure gold. Freddy outlines his unique style on every track, and wastes no time showing new listeners what hes all about. The second and most played track on the EP "Homework Did" hits hard with a funky bassline, and computerized binural overtones. This EP includes a remix of the song "Tanson" by Space Jesus. I find this remix to be better than the original song. I highly recommend this EP to anyone who likes electronic music.</p>
